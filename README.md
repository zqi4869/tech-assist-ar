What is FieldVerse
Your extra hands and eyes on the field, add on to the human experience. FieldVerse takes the simple tools you have on you like smart watch, protective glasses, software and elevates these things to make any job faster and safer. There are three key elements.

Office Frontend: 
More than a simple worker's hub
-Provide detailed instructions before the job
-Provides all needed equipment for the job and provides their location and usability status
-Map of the venue for locating the problem easily, as well as all relevant elements like routers, power outlet and Ethernet port
-A detailed library of the past, present and future problems and how to solve them. Their symptoms and steps.
-AI software creates automatic notes while on the job, the worker can add his own using speech to text.
-Guarantees that all changes to the area are recorded and noted.

Smart Watch: 
Adding to its handiness
-Makes notes of sudden movements to ensure delicate parts aren't damaged.
-Keeps track of posture, heartrate and potential falls of the worker, ensuring their safety and well-being.
-Using Doublepoint's gesture recognition software, the worker can pull up information and notes on his goggles if he has his hands entirely tied.

XR Glasses:
Simple protection becomes your second pair of eyes
-Guides the field engineer with troubleshooting and repairing. 
-Films and takes pictures of the process for future recollection.
-Collects customer service data for improvement.
-Collects verification of each safety step being completed.
-Keeps track of rules and regulations as well as reminds of the most common mistakes to ensure compliance.
-Reminds of the GDPR rules while recording and collecting data
-Shows 3D scans of the inside of routers and guides hand movement
